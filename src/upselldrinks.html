        <h3 class="article-info__heading">How do you effectively upsell?</h3>
        <p class="article-info__text text">
          The most effective way to upsell is to make it as natural of a process as possible. If you're being overtly
          pushy or
          obvious with your upselling techniques, customers will sense that and shy away from it. How to upsell is all
          about how
          to open a line of dialogue with customers that invites them to experiment with other products. To effectively
          upsell, it
          has to feel like you're not upselling. That's a hard thing to learn, but once you've got it down upselling
          will
          become
          second nature.</p>

          As a bartender, upselling is one of the best ways to increase sales. Any one instance of upselling won't make
          a huge
          difference in sales, but as you continue to upsell and get even better at it, you'll find yourself making a
          steady
          impact on bar sales. If you want to increase sales, work on your upselling techniques and soon enough you'll
          be making

        <h3 class="article-info__heading">How do you upsell a serving?</h3>
        <p class="article-info__text text">
          How to upsell an individual serving comes down to drink-mixing knowledge. Throughout this article, we
          mentioned several
          times the practice of suggesting a different cocktail ingredients or a take on a drink. Knowing your drink
          mixes well,
          and being able to recommend alternative liquors and blends will be a great tool in continual upselling.</p>

      <h3 class="article-info__heading">How to Upsell Wine Techniques?</h3>
      <p class="article-info__text text">
        To figure out how to upsell wine as a bartender, you need to learn everything you can about the wines you’re
        selling.
        Wine, more than anything else being sold at a bar, requires expertise to upsell. That includes where they’re
        from, how
        they taste, and what they pair well with. This will pay dividends as wine profitability is higher than other
        types of
        alcohol. Selling more wine will also keep you from finding out the hard way can wine go bad.</p>
